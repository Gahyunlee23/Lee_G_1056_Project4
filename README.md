# 190702 Mediaquery
I created 4 div boxes and give them a mediaquery functions to change the shapes or colors based on the sizes.

## Description

I put the min-width and max-width to set the range that colors and display are fixed at the default. Whenever the figure gets out from the field, the colors and display are changed.
